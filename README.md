# Bashop

Bashop is a bash framework which makes your life easier if you want to write an bash application. It comes with the following features:

* Argument parser
* Automated help pages


### Restrictions ###

Don't let the name of your app functions start with _bashop::_ and don't let your global variable names start with _BASHOP_ or _\_BASHOP_.
No there is no way, expect you want to break something, don't even think about it. :)
